# Pre-warning

This presentation was *a lot* harder than I thought it would be!

-   Org-mode is great, but perhaps intimidating (emacs, setup&#x2026;)
-   Emacs itself can be quite a barrier to entry
-   Background knowledge needed for feature `x` to make sense
-   There's a gazillion features I would love to talk about but can't

---

# My approach

-   Overview of some features
-   Demo of an Org file
-   Export with a few backends

# The life of a product developer

Stuff I do in the course of my work (probably not that different from you!):

## Direct     :B_block:BMCOL:

-   write up experimental plans
-   do experiments
-   collect/analyze data
-   writeup reports/presentations
-   share/collaborate with others

## Indirect     :B_block:BMCOL:

-   record all sorts of info
-   meeting notes
-   manage todos
-   store contact info/notes
-   what to work on and when
-   emails

# What the hell does emacs have to do with it?

Believe it or not, I *learned Emacs* for `org-mode`. To date, it's the *only* solution I'm
aware of that allows for all of the following in one place:

-   notes
-   todos/time stamping/deadlines
-   tags/properties
-   embedded code + execution
-   export to multiple formats, with images, links, table of contents, automatically
    generated code blocks and/or results&#x2026;

\pause

*Pretty cool!*

# Some competition

I've always been a note taker, as I like to refer to the past&#x2026; you never know what
might be useful in the future! I tried all sorts of programs:
